Eight months later, Setty & Associates, Ltd., a Virginia corporation, entered into a subcontract with Finegold to provide mechanical and electrical designs for the project. During the course of the work, the government project officer requested several changes that required Setty to revise its designs. Setty submitted a certified claim in Finegold\\u00a1\\u00afs name to GSA for additional compensation for the work required by these changes. GSA opposed the claim on the ground of \\u00a1\\u00b0accord and satisfaction,\\u00a1\\u00b1 arguing that Finegold had already agreed to the amount of increased compensation GSA would pay for the additional work. The Contracting Officer denied the claim, and Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs administrative appeal, prosecuted in Finegold\\u00a1\\u00afs name, was subsequently dismissed for lack of prosecution after Finegold refused to finance the litigation. \\nSetty then filed a demand for arbitration before the American Arbitration Association seeking damages from Finegold. In a series of twelve claims, Setty alleged that Finegold had violated the subcontract by failing to provide timely and accurate information, failing to present Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs request for equitable adjustment to GSA, and failing to distribute to Setty an equitable share of the additional compensation it had received from GSA. After considering briefs submitted by the parties, the arbitrators appointed to hear the case concluded that the matter was arbitrable. Finegold filed suit in D.C. Superior Court to stay the arbitration proceedings. Setty removed the case to federal district court, alleging diversity of citizenship. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court concluded that most of Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs claims were not arbitrable. The court stayed three of Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs claims in part and stayed the remaining claims in full. This appeal followed. \\nArticle 4(a) of the subcontract permitted Finegold \\u00a1\\u00b0at any time, unilaterally\\u00a1\\u00b1 to \\u00a1\\u00b0make changes in the general scope of this Subcontract,\\u00a1\\u00b1 in which case Setty was obligated to \\u00a1\\u00b0perform the work as changed without delay.\\u00a1\\u00b1 Under Article 4(c), Setty could submit to Finegold a proposal for equitable adjustment to reflect the additional costs imposed by such changes. Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs additional compensation was limited to an \\u00a1\\u00b0equitable share of any adjustment in [Finegold]\\u00a1\\u00afs Prime Contract with GSA,\\u00a1\\u00b1 and Setty had to submit its proposal \\u00a1\\u00b0at least five (5) working days before [Finegold] [was] required to submit such proposal to GSA under the terms of the Prime Contract.\\u00a1\\u00b1 \\nIn the event of a dispute between Finegold and Setty \\u00a1\\u00b0which involve[d] the Government or the terms of the Prime Contract,\\u00a1\\u00b1 Article 9(a) of the subcontract provided that Setty was bound to Finegold to the same extent that Finegold was bound to GSA. On the other hand, under Article 9(c) \\u00a1\\u00b0any dispute or any controversy between [Finegold] and [Setty] not involving the Government or the terms of the Prime Contract\\u00a1\\u00b1 had to be resolved through binding arbitration (emphasis in original); in the interim, before the dispute was resolved, the subcontractor was bound to follow the instructions of the prime contractor \\u00a1\\u00b0without interruption, deficiency, or delay.\\u00a1\\u00b1 The subcontract also permitted Setty to pursue claims against the government in Finegold\\u00a1\\u00afs name so long as Finegold had \\u00a1\\u00b0a reasonable opportunity to monitor and participate in any such claim or dispute.\\u00a1\\u00b1\\n The case turns on the meaning of Article 9(c). The district court thought the provision precluded arbitration of all claims that \\u00a1\\u00b0require either an interpretation of the prime contractor [sic] an evaluation of the government\\u00a1\\u00afs behavior for their resolution.\\u00a1\\u00b1 We shall assume that this construction, which Finegold endorses, is plausible. Whether it should carry the day is another matter. Much depends on the generosity with which arbitration clauses must be judicially interpreted.\\n On this score, holding that courts must compel arbitration unless there is \\u00a1\\u00b0positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\\u00a1\\u00b1 [sic] Both AT & T Technologies and Warrior & Gulf involved labor disputes; both were suits brought by unions to compel arbitration; and both arose under \\u00a1\\u00d7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. When the Court decided Warrior & Gulf, it perceived judicial \\u00a1\\u00b0hostility\\u00a1\\u00b1 toward arbitration of commercial disagreements, echoing Judge Frank\\u00a1\\u00afs lament. But labor disputes, the Court thought, were in a different category: in the commercial context, the alternative to arbitration was a lawsuit; in the labor context, the alternative was a strike or a lockout. When the Supreme Court\\u00a1\\u00afs views toward commercial arbitration later shifted from \\u00a1\\u00b0hostility\\u00a1\\u00b1 to endorsement, the Warrior & Gulf distinction between labor arbitration and commercial arbitration began to fade from memory. And so, in recent years, it is scarcely surprising to find this court and others citing labor arbitration decisions such as AT & T Technologies in commercial arbitration cases.1 Still, we must recognize that Warrior & Gulf and the cases following it formulated standards derived from 301 and national labor policy, while the modern doctrine favoring commercial arbitration stemmed from the Federal Arbitration Act. There may no longer be much of a distinction between the two lines of cases, but precision constrains us to avoid treating them interchangeably.\\n Although in commercial disputes to which the Federal Arbitration Act applies, such as the one before us,2 the \\u00a1\\u00b0positive assurance\\u00a1\\u00b1 test of Warrior & Gulf may not control, a nearly equivalent standard does: \\u00a1\\u00b0any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\\u00a1\\u00b1 Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs interpretation of Article 9(c) is that a dispute cannot be one \\u00a1\\u00b0involving the Government or the terms of the Prime Contract\\u00a1\\u00b1 unless relief is sought from the government or pursuant to the terms of the prime contract. Setty seeks relief from Finegold, and only Finegold. It alleges no government breach and asserts no rights under the prime contract. If we accepted Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs reading of Article 9(c), its claims would therefore be arbitrable. Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs interpretation certainly makes sense in a situation in which the government agrees to pay the prime contractor additional compensation for extra work and the prime contractor then directs the subcontractor to perform the work, which is more than the subcontract contemplated. If the subcontractor seeks extra pay for the extra work, its grievance would be solely with the prime contractor. Although the government requested the work, the dispute would not \\u00a1\\u00b0involve\\u00a1\\u00b1 the government?the government did not act in violation of the prime contract and it did not do anything exposing it to liability to the subcontractor. We do not decide whether this is what happened here. Our only concern is with arbitrability. Faced with two possible constructions of Article 9, one in favor of arbitration, the other against, the scales tip in favor of Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs interpretation, which seems to us the more plausible in any event. There is no indication that the parties intended to preclude arbitration of the sort of claims Setty advances and there is every indication that the parties meant to resolve their differences through arbitration. Any doubts on this subject must be settled in favor of arbitrability.\\n We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court in part and direct it to permit arbitration of all of Setty\\u00a1\\u00afs claims.\",\n          \"This case presents the fundamental question of whether a government contractor\\u00a1\\u00afs duty to continue performance under the standard \\u00a1\\u00b0Disputes\\u00a1\\u00b1 clause is absolute, or whether the contractor is excused from that duty when the Government fails to provide reasonable clarification of a contract\\u00a1\\u00afs scope of work upon request.\\n Plaintiff Vanguard Construction, Inc. (\\u00a1\\u00b0Vanguard\\u00a1\\u00b1) challenges a decision by the U.S. Air Force (\\u00a1\\u00b0USAF\\u00a1\\u00b1) to terminate for default a task order for replacement of the roof of Building 8451 located at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Vanguard claims that the termination for default was improper because completion of the roof was not possible after discovery of a latent defect in the existing stem wall or parapet around the perimeter of the roof. Vanguard further maintains that the Government failed to cooperate with it in its requests for information needed to devise a solution to the problem. The sole relief sought by Plaintiff is a conversion of the default termination into a termination for convenience. Defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment in its favor, arguing that as a matter of law, the terms of the task order and related contract allocate to Vanguard, the risk of dealing with latent or unanticipated site conditions and the burden of devising a solution to the problem, without further input or assistance from the Air Force. Thus the Government maintains that as a matter of law, the default termination was justified because Vanguard did not complete the roof as required by the terms of the contract. The Court finds that genuine issues of material fact are presented in this case, and therefore, denies Defendant\\u00a1\\u00afs motion for summary judgment.\\nIn September 2007, Vanguard and the USAF entered into an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for construction of roof replacement and repairs on designated buildings at Edwards Air Force Base. That contract incorporated by reference standard portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\\u00a1\\u00b0FAR\\u00a1\\u00b1) relevant to decision here. Def. Mot. Summ. J., App. A1?116. Pursuant to that contract, in December 2009 the USAF issued to Vanguard a request for proposal including a Statement of Work to repair the roof on Building 8451, id. at A117?124, and Plaintiff submitted a proposal that month, id. at A125?126. Thereafter, the USAF awarded Task Order No. 0037 for Building 8451 (the \\u00a1\\u00b0task order\\u00a1\\u00b1) to Plaintiff in May 2010, and in August 2010, issued a Notice to Proceed. The Notice to Proceed called for the project to begin in September 2010 and to be completed by February 5, 2011. \\n At the beginning of performance, Vanguard demolished and removed the existing gravel roof, which required also removing a portion of a metal storage structure sitting on top of the roof. Vanguard then submitted to the USAF a letter dated November 9, 2010 stating that the demolition had revealed that a sixty-foot section of the roof stem wall was missing. The letter stated that \\u00a1\\u00b0[t]he existing condition is incompatible with the specified roof system\\u00a1\\u00b1 and asked for direction on how to proceed including a request for information on structural requirements for building a stem wall and any modifications to the storage building, because the Statement of Work did not address this issue. A November 18, 2010 response from the USAF declared that the missing stem wall condition was visible prior to the recent roof demolition and should have been accounted for in Plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs original proposal. The response was silent on Plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs request for information. Id. at 147. Plaintiff replied in a November 22, 2010 letter, denying that the condition was visible prior to demolition, and reiterating its request for direction on structural and other issues related to design and building of the new portion of the stem wall.  \\nThe parties apparently reached an impasse. Although there was correspondence between them in the five months before the USAF issued a Notice of Default, the Air Force never provided the information sought by Vanguard. Rather, Defendant continued to maintain that this problem was within the scope of the original roofing task order. Plaintiff completed approximately eighty-five to ninety percent of the installation of the new roof by the end of December 2010, leaving undone the roofing near the missing stem wall, which it continued to maintain was incompatible with the roofing system being installed. In January 2011, Vanguard \\u00a1\\u00b0demobilized\\u00a1\\u00b1 from the project site, claiming that there was no more work able to be completed. In May 2011, the USAF issued to Vanguard a Notice of Default and terminated the task order. Compl. Ex. A. The Notice of Default cited Plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs failure to comply with its duty to proceed with performance pending resolution, as required by the contract\\u00a1\\u00afs \\u00a1\\u00b0Disputes\\u00a1\\u00b1 clause (incorporating FAR \\u00a1\\u00d7 52?233?1(i)).\\nAs noted, the question presented in this case is whether Plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs failure to complete the roofing contract was excused by the Air Force\\u00a1\\u00afs failure to provide reasonable clarification of the scope of work, and whether the termination for default should be converted to a termination for convenience. The Government argues that the contract and task order \\u00a1\\u00b0placed the responsibility for inspection of the project site, assessment of work, and determination of means and methods of performance upon Vanguard.\\u00a1\\u00b1 Defendant further argues that the stem wall deficiency was visible at the time the task order was issued, but also maintains that Vanguard was responsible even if the stem wall problem had not been visible at that time, and that Vanguard had a duty to proceed with performance. Plaintiff maintains on the other hand, that latency of the condition at the outset excuses its failure to address the issue at that time, and further, that its failure to complete the roof was justified by the Government\\u00a1\\u00afs refusal to provide guidance and the design and building specifications necessary to remedy the defect.\\nIn this case there are at least two clearly disputed facts material to Plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs justification argument. The Government claims (and Plaintiff denies) that the state of the stem wall was visible before Vanguard submitted its proposal. This fact is material because the default provision in the contract limits a default finding where delay \\u00a1\\u00b0arises from unforeseeable causes beyond the control\\u00a1\\u00b1 of the contractor. The second issue is whether the additional information repeatedly requested by Plaintiff was actually necessary to address the stem wall deficiency. The Defendant argues that adaptation of part of a stem wall for use in roofing would be part of a roofing plan and requires no further knowledge of the building itself. Plaintiff disputes this, maintaining that because a stem wall is part of the building structure with separate design issues, it is not normally part of a roofing project, and it could not proceed without the information and advice requested from Defendant. Clearly, resolution of each of these fact disputes is material to determining the reasonableness of the parties\\u00a1\\u00af conduct in this matter.\\n Because there remain material facts to be determined, Defendant\\u00a1\\u00afs motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The Court requests the parties to submit a joint status report within 14 days, on or before September 22, 2015, providing a proposed schedule for the next steps in this case.\",\n          \"In June 1976 Santa Fe Engineers, Inc. (Santa Fe) entered into a contract with the Government for an addition and alterations to Ireland Army Hospital, Fort Knox, Kentucky, for a lump sum price of $28,664,649. The work to be done under the contract included additions to and renovation of the existing hospital buildings, as well as additions to the parking facilities and other work at the site. The contract required completion of the work within four years from the date (July 26, 1976) Santa Fe acknowledged receipt of the Government\\u00a1\\u00afs notice to proceed. The work was to be done in phases and was completed in July 1981.\\n This case started with three changes issued by the Government, designated \\u00a1\\u00b0AD,\\u00a1\\u00b1 \\u00a1\\u00b0CD\\u00a1\\u00b1 and \\u00a1\\u00b0HK.\\u00a1\\u00b1 Santa Fe ultimately certified to the contracting officer a claim for these three changes of over ten million dollars for increased impact costs due to the changes (later reduced to about five million dollars). The contracting officer allowed only slightly over $166,000 on the three claims.\\n Santa Fe appealed to the Board asserting that the labor impact of the three changes was far more extensive (amounting to almost five million dollars) than the contracting officer had allowed. The Board held a hearing, made extensive findings, and then determined that (1) appellant had made only a \\u00a1\\u00b0total labor cost presentation\\u00a1\\u00b1 to the Board, acknowledging that it could not identify any particular impact associated with the three particular changes, (2) the Board thus had no basis for awarding any additional sum on any of the three specific changes before it, and (3) the Board had no jurisdiction over Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs additional general claim for its total increase in costs because that general claim had never been presented or certified to the contracting officer. proof? pre-requisites issue? Petitioner\\u00a1\\u00afs major contention before us is that it did not urge, before the Board, any different claim than the one it had certified to the contracting officer.\\nThe record clearly sustains the Board\\u00a1\\u00afs determination that Santa Fe made no effort to prove the additional impact costs due to the three particular change orders appealed to the Board, but instead sought to show its total labor costs. Finding 39 finds: \\u00a1\\u00b0Evidence was submitted by appellant to the Board as to the labor costs incurred for the entire work, and as to the amounts to be deducted from such expenditures on account of \\u00a1\\u00aebid estimate labor,\\u00a1\\u00af payments made for \\u00a1\\u00aechange order labor\\u00a1\\u00af and \\u00a1\\u00aeextended overhead labor,\\u00a1\\u00af and other credits\\u00a1\\u00b1 (emphasis added). Above all, Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs proposed findings of fact (before the Board) stated (under the heading \\u00a1\\u00b0NATURE OF THE CLAIM?TOTAL JOB DISRUPTION\\u00a1\\u00b1).\\n Later on in its proposed findings, appellant explicitly said: \\u00a1\\u00b0It was not possible to identify any particular impact associated with any particular change. That is why Santa Fe Engineers ended up utilizing a total labor cost approach to its impact claim.\\u00a1\\u00b1  Obviously, there was more than substantial evidence sustaining the Board\\u00a1\\u00afs findings as to the deficiencies of Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs case before the Board on the extra costs attributable to the three specific change orders.\\n The next, and more significant, issue is whether Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs general presentation was beyond the claims certified to the contracting officer and therefore beyond the Board\\u00a1\\u00afs authority to consider. It is now elementary that, for claims (such as those now before us) brought under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978,1 the claim must be in writing and submitted to the contracting officer for a decision.. If for more than $50,000 (like those we are now considering), the claim must also be certified. \\u00a1\\u00b0Lack of proper certification, where required, deprives the contracting officer, the board of contract appeals, and this court (on review) of jurisdiction to proceed on the claim.\\u00a1\\u00b1 On appeal to the Board or in a direct access action in the Claims Court, a contractor may increase the amount of his claim, but may not raise any new claims not presented and certified to the contracting officer. [This] is because \\u00a1\\u00b0the certification requirement applies to submission of claims to the contracting officer....\\u00a1\\u00b1.\\n Here, the Board expressly found that Santa Fe had improperly urged a new claim on appeal to the Board.2 There is ample record support for this determination. To show this support, we deal first with the claim Santa Fe actually presented to the contracting officer. That written claim (dated March 11, 1981) sought $10,259,624.72 \\u00a1\\u00b0for delay and impact costs emanating from Change Order Nos. 37 (\\u00a1\\u00b0AD\\u00a1\\u00b1) and 102 (\\u00a1\\u00b0CD\\u00a1\\u00b1)...\\u00a1\\u00b1 The contracting officer\\u00a1\\u00afs response (dated July 27, 1981) starts out by stating \\u00a1\\u00b0you claim additional money for delay in impact costs resulting from changes \\u00a1\\u00aeAD\\u00a1\\u00af and \\u00a1\\u00aeCD\\u00a1\\u00af under the above referenced contract,\\u00a1\\u00b1 and then proceeds to set forth his view of the facts concerning those particular changes. There follows the contracting officer\\u00a1\\u00afs \\u00a1\\u00b0ANALYSIS\\u00a1\\u00b1 which he commences as follows: \\u00a1\\u00b0You contend that as a result of Changes \\u00a1\\u00aeAD\\u00a1\\u00af and \\u00a1\\u00aeCD\\u00a1\\u00af, you incurred costs in the amount of *859 $10,259,624.72,\\u00a1\\u00b1 and continues by discussing those two changes; he concludes that nothing additional is due on change \\u00a1\\u00b0AD\\u00a1\\u00b1 and that on change \\u00a1\\u00b0CD\\u00a1\\u00b1 only $166,396 more is due. Finally, in the \\u00a1\\u00b0DETERMINATION\\u00a1\\u00b1 portion of his ruling the contracting officer determines that $166,396 will be paid by the Government on change \\u00a1\\u00b0CD.\\u00a1\\u00b1\\n Santa Fe appealed to the Board and initially its claim there was precisely the same type of claim as had been proffered to the contracting officer; its original complaint was specifically directed to changes \\u00a1\\u00b0AD\\u00a1\\u00b1 and \\u00a1\\u00b0CD\\u00a1\\u00b1 and the contracting officer\\u00a1\\u00afs decision of July 27, 1984 thereon (discussed immediately supra ).3 No other claims were set forth. Similarly, petitioner\\u00a1\\u00afs original answers (in October 1982) to the Government\\u00a1\\u00afs interrogatories restricted the claims to those three changes.\\nThe disruption and interference which caused the excess labor costs involved here were rooted in two basic areas: (1) Change \\u00a1\\u00aeAD\\u00a1\\u00af work and impact on unchanged work, and (2) Change \\u00a1\\u00aeCD\\u00a1\\u00af and \\u00a1\\u00aeHK\\u00a1\\u00af rescheduling and acceleration. The combined effect of these three changes disrupted the entire project from the issuance of Change \\u00a1\\u00aeAD\\u00a1\\u00af on April 8, 1977 until its completion in 1981.\\nUp to that point, in a word, petitioner\\u00a1\\u00afs claim was plainly restricted to the three particular change orders we have mentioned (\\u00a1\\u00b0CD,\\u00a1\\u00b1 \\u00a1\\u00b0AD,\\u00a1\\u00b1 \\u00a1\\u00b0HK\\u00a1\\u00b1) and to those change orders alone. \\n There followed a period of litigation as to whether Santa Fe had properly certified its claim. In its preliminary opinion of July 31, 1984, the Board decided that the first appeal was inadequate because the certification outstanding at that time had been made only by counsel, not by the company itself. However, the Board ruled (in the same opinion) that the proper certification had been made in Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs later answers (October 1982) to the Government\\u00a1\\u00afs interrogatories, and on that basis sustained Board jurisdiction over that certified claim.5\\n When proceedings resumed before the Board on the merits of Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs certified claim, a profound alteration occurred in the scope of that claim. As we have already indicated (in Part I, supra ), in its proposed findings of fact submitted to the Board with respect to the hearing, Santa Fe now characterized its claim as \\u00a1\\u00b0total job disruption\\u00a1\\u00b1 and declared explicitly that its claim represented not only the total impact from change orders \\u00a1\\u00b0CD\\u00a1\\u00b1 and \\u00a1\\u00b0HK\\u00a1\\u00b1 but also expressly added: \\u00a1\\u00b0and from the collective nature of all the problems, changes and directives issued on the project.... A multiplicity of change orders were issued at Fort Knox to resolve and to correct problems, and the problems are what the claim is based on\\u00a1\\u00b1 (emphasis added). This addition of a claim arising \\u00a1\\u00b0from the collective nature of all the problems, changes and directives that were issued on the project\\u00a1\\u00b1 was entirely new and had never been presented to the contracting officer, or certified to him.\\nThe hearing record shows that Santa Fe strenuously sought to prove this new and additional claim before the Board. Not only did petitioner\\u00a1\\u00afs representatives attribute the claim it was now making before the Board to the collective nature of all changes or the multiplicity of change orders or design difficulties unrelated to those three particular change orders on which its original claim was grounded, but such unrelated problems were directly brought out as part of petitioner\\u00a1\\u00afs claim. \\nThe upshot is that we have no basis for overturning the Board\\u00a1\\u00afs decision that Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs claim for the additional costs attributable to \\u00a1\\u00b0all the problems, changes and directives that were issued on the project\\u00a1\\u00b1 was not properly before the Board because not a claim previously certified to the contracting officer. \\nFor these reasons, we affirm the Board\\u00a1\\u00afs determinations (1) that Santa Fe had proved no additional costs with respect to changes \\u00a1\\u00b0AD,\\u00a1\\u00b1 \\u00a1\\u00b0CD\\u00a1\\u00b1 and \\u00a1\\u00b0HK\\u00a1\\u00b1, and accordingly that Santa Fe was entitled only to the $166,396 awarded it by the contracting officer on those claims, and (2) dismissing all of Santa Fe\\u00a1\\u00afs other claims argued before the Board.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summarized_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This case involves the plaintiff, Consolidated Engineering Co., against the defendant, the United States. The plaintiff sought to recover a total sum of $5,836.27 for money alleged to be due under a contract for the construction of a post office building at Grants Pass, Oregon, entered into with the United States Government on September 19, 1935. Regarding the twelve items constituting the claim, the Court denied all of them and concluded that the plaintiff takes nothing by its complaint. The Court commented that there was an element of one-sidedness to public work contracts in that disputes should be determined either by certain designated officials or by departmental appeal, and the contractor dissatisfied with the action of the official or the department could only recover when he showed bad faith or fraud in making the determination. In this case, the conclusion reached was not only sustained by the evidence (e.g. with regard to the plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs claim on liquidated damages, violations of eight-hour law, inspection expense), but also commanded by the fact that each of the items involved factual disputes to which the determination of the engineer was given finality, either through failure of the contractor to appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury or through the action of the latter on appeal (e.g. with regard to the plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs claim on change of concrete mix, plaster waterproofing, reset floor in boiler room, sewer manhole).\",\n          \"The plaintiff contracted with the Navy to install concrete catch basins in the parking lot within a 60?day period beginning September 1, 1975. During construction, the plaintiff pointed out that the specifications for the basins did not include any steel reinforcing bars in the concrete work. The Navy decided that rebars should be included and requested the plaintiff to submit a price proposa on October 3, 1975. On November 10, 1975, the Navy, having not yet received the requested proposal, formally directed the rebar installation. The work on the catch basins was completed in April 1976. As the parties couldn\\u00a1\\u00aft reach an agreement on the price, a legal dispute has began. The plaintiff contended that the early work had to be redone because of weather-caused deterioration, leading to a 40?day delay. Regarding the plaintiff\\u00a1\\u00afs claim for costs, the Board did not accept any of the costs associated with the repair of weather damage since the plaintiff failed to take precautions against the potential of erosion. As to the claim for the 40?day contract extension, the Board did not accept that claim for the following reasons: (i) completion of the catch basin construction by early October 1975 would not have been possible because of undelivered materials(storm drain steel frames and gratings), (ii) delays after mid-October 1975 were because the plaintiff did not submit a price proposal, (iii) there were no unusual weather conditions between October and November 10, 1975, (iv) the catch basin work involved only marginal effort(a total of 12 hours for the installation of rebar and the placement of 3 cubic yards of concrete) and could have been completed at any time, (v) it was not on the critical path.
